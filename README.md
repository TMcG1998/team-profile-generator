  ## Installation
  
  To install, begin by cloning the code into a desired location on the user's PC. Using command line, navigate into the develop folder. From there, type 'node index' and return/enter. The app will start.
  
  ## Usage
  
  The app accepts simple strings as answers. If an answer is empty, they will be prompted to enter that value again. After the team is created, an HTML file will be created within the 'dist' directory.

  ## How to Contribute
      
  Contributions on this project are currently closed, as it is completed for the forseeable future.
      
  ## Tests
      
  To run the tests, from the root directory type "npm run test" inside of the console. This will use the Jest test framework to run 7 tests that already exist, but more can easily be created if needed.
